Kinematic algorithms based on Conformal geometic algebra. 

The Matlab-functions are forward and inverse kinematic functions for 6-SPS stewart platforms. The script "benchmark_stewart.m" is used
for benchmarking of CGA algorithm against conventional spatial kinematics in 3D space.

The CLUViz-scripts include forward and inverse kinematic program for a 6.dof Comau Smart-5 industrial robot. There is also a program for
the invers kinematic of a stewart platform. It is recommended to run these files in CLUViz and not CLUCalc, or else there might be trouble 
with the joint angles.
